# shitty-remenu

Aloha everybody! My name is Jon, I am force behind running CTC, but also I have been working on a product called Remenu where restaurant owners can adjust their menu on the fly. In order to make this work, there needs to be a data driven menu algorithm. I thought it would be fun to make a coding challenge out of it, and see what people come up with.

## The Challenge

In order to pass this challenge, you will need to write code that will take the `restaurant` data structure and output HTML that represents the menu.

What you don't need to worry about is:

- Building a good UI for changing a menu <-- this is probably one of the hardest parts of actually building Remenu IMO
- Any other app stuff

What you do need to code in order to pass this challenge is:

- Write code that will take the `restaurant` data structure and output HTML that represents the menu
- Write CSS that will style the menu

## Tech Stack

As you can see, I have a boilerplate vite project setup for you but you are welcome to use whatever tools you want. I've also solved this challenge myself with react + tailwind just for fun. Follow your heart!

If you do choose to use this repository, you should be able to run `npm install` even though this was setup with bun. Then to start the dev server, run `npm run dev`. If you do happen to have bun, you can also run `bun run dev` and it will use bun instead.

In the `index.html` file, you will see a `restaurant-container` div, this is where the menu will be rendered. For your convienence we have also included a `reset.css` file that will make sure all browser styles are reset. What you will not see in this repository is the script.ts file that will be responsible for taking the restaurant data and outputting the HTML or the styles.ts file that will be responsible for styling the menu. This is because I want to see what you come up with!

## What we are looking for

In style-targets.ts, you will see a list of styles that we are targeting, I only included two breakpoints because I'm lazy, but you are welcome to go as deep or as shallow as you want on this.

## Submission

I'm not grading any of this, but if you want to share your solution, please feel free to post it on the thread where you see this challenge in the #fun-challenges channel on CTC.

One fun way of submitting this could be to show it off in a loom video, but please feel free to do whatever you want.
